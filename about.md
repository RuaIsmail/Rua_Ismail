Hello everyone or (nobody), my name is Rua Ismail from Khartoum, Sudan. I am a statistics and computer science graduate. Currently I am a teaching assistant at university of Khartoum, department of statistics also I work at statistical consulting unit at University of Khartoum and Software developer at Next technology for banking solution.

I love data, I’ve always been mesmerized by it, the applications , challenges and creativity of the solutions. The way by understanding data, we understand our self , and the world around us. It’s about asking the right questions and do the right analyses to answer those questions. 
 Every second we generate massive amount of data from microbiology to data from the universe ,its shape, our sagacity on how to preserve the world . And then it’s about bending the technology to serve us instead of us serving the technology. 
 I am passionate about shaping and creating new thing from a very early age, I remember creating new games in school and with by brother and sisters. And this passion somehow drives me into data science because it involves creating new model using existing knowledge, concepts and tool to solve your real word problem.
The endless possibilities, creativity of solutions, the freedom to ask questions and dig for answers, the logic, the complexity of the simple, the challenge to self, widening of your thought and world.
    
  
I would like to be a data scientist; this blog is my way to be a data scientist.
     
I am writing for myself and for ambitious people who want to learn the concepts and they are busy and in the same time want to get in-depth understanding. I hope someone out there find it interesting and informative.
